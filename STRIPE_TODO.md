# Stripe Integration - Future Improvements

## Current Implementation Status

✅ **Implemented:**
- Basic product management
- Checkout session creation
- Webhook handlers with transactions
- Idempotent webhook processing
- Partial refund handling
- Customer creation with rollback
- Stock validation in transactions

## Known Limitations & Future Improvements

### 1. Stock Reservation System (Medium Priority)

**Current Issue:**
There's a small race condition window between stock check and order creation. Two users can simultaneously:
1. Check stock (both see 1 item available)
2. Both create orders
3. First payment succeeds → stock becomes 0
4. Second payment succeeds → stock becomes -1 (oversold!)

**Solution:**
Implement a reservation system:
```typescript
// Reserve stock when checkout starts
await prisma.stockReservation.create({
  productId,
  quantity,
  expiresAt: Date.now() + 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
})

// Release on payment success or expiration
```

**Complexity:** Medium
**Impact:** High for popular products

### 2. Webhook Retry Logic (Low Priority)

**Current Issue:**
If webhook processing fails, Stripe will retry, but we don't have exponential backoff or dead letter queue.

**Solution:**
- Add retry counter to webhook processing
- Implement exponential backoff
- Create failed webhook log table
- Add admin UI to manually retry failed webhooks

**Complexity:** Medium
**Impact:** Low (Stripe handles most retry logic)

---

### 3. Inventory Alerts (Low Priority)

**Current Issue:**
No notification when stock is low or oversold.

**Solution:**
- Add triggers or scheduled jobs to check stock levels
- Send alerts when stock < threshold
- Alert on negative stock (overselling detected)

**Complexity:** Low
**Impact:** Medium for business operations

---

### 4. Order Cancellation (Medium Priority)

**Current Issue:**
No way to cancel an order before payment or after PENDING status.

**Solution:**
- Add `cancelOrder` server action
- Cancel Stripe session if not paid
- Restore stock if order was PAID but not shipped
- Update order status to CANCELLED

**Complexity:** Low
**Impact:** Medium for customer service

---

### 5. Shipping Cost Calculation (High Priority)

**Current Issue:**
Shipping cost is hardcoded to 0.

**Solution:**
- Integrate with shipping API (e.g., Shippo, EasyPost)
- Calculate based on weight, dimensions, destination
- Add shipping rates to Stripe checkout

**Complexity:** High
**Impact:** High (required for real business)

---

### 6. Tax Calculation (High Priority)

**Current Issue:**
Tax is hardcoded to 0.

**Solution:**
- Use Stripe Tax (automatic tax calculation)
- Or integrate with tax service (TaxJar, Avalara)
- Calculate based on shipping address

**Complexity:** Medium
**Impact:** High (legal requirement in many jurisdictions)

---

### 7. Multi-Currency Support (Low Priority)

**Current Issue:**
Only EUR and USD supported, manual price entry for each.

**Solution:**
- Use Stripe's automatic currency conversion
- Or integrate with exchange rate API
- Store base currency, calculate others dynamically

**Complexity:** Medium
**Impact:** Low (unless expanding internationally)

---

### 8. Product Variants (Medium Priority)

**Current Issue:**
No support for product variants (size, color, etc.)

**Solution:**
- Add `ProductVariant` table
- Link variants to base product
- Each variant has own stock, price, Stripe price ID

**Complexity:** High
**Impact:** Medium (depends on product catalog)

---

### 9. Discount Codes / Coupons (Low Priority)

**Current Issue:**
No discount system.

**Solution:**
- Use Stripe Coupons/Promotion Codes
- Add coupon code field to checkout
- Apply discount in Stripe session

**Complexity:** Low
**Impact:** Medium for marketing

---

### 10. Email Notifications (High Priority)

**Current Issue:**
No email notifications for order confirmation, shipping updates, etc.

**Solution:**
- Integrate email service (Resend, SendGrid, AWS SES)
- Send emails on:
  - Order confirmation (payment succeeded)
  - Order shipped (with tracking number)
  - Refund processed
- Use email templates

**Complexity:** Medium
**Impact:** High (customer expectation)

---

### 11. Admin Dashboard (High Priority)

**Current Issue:**
No UI for managing orders, viewing analytics.

**Solution:**
- Create admin pages:
  - Orders list with filters
  - Order detail view
  - Update order status
  - Process refunds
  - View sales analytics
- Add charts/graphs for revenue, popular products

**Complexity:** High
**Impact:** High for business operations

---

### 12. Webhook Signature Verification Logging (Low Priority)

**Current Issue:**
Failed signature verifications are logged but not tracked.

**Solution:**
- Log all webhook attempts to database
- Track failed verifications
- Alert on suspicious activity
- Add admin UI to view webhook logs

**Complexity:** Low
**Impact:** Low (security monitoring)

---

### 13. Rate Limiting (Low Priority)

**Current Issue:**
No rate limiting on checkout creation.

**Solution:**
- Add rate limiting middleware
- Limit checkout attempts per user/IP
- Prevent abuse

**Complexity:** Low
**Impact:** Low (unless under attack)

---

### 14. Testing (Medium Priority)

**Current Issue:**
No automated tests for Stripe integration.

**Solution:**
- Unit tests for server actions
- Integration tests with Stripe test mode
- Mock webhook events for testing
- E2E tests for checkout flow

**Complexity:** Medium
**Impact:** High for confidence in production
