# server

Server-side functions and database operations organized by domain:

- **actions.ts** - Server Actions for data mutations (create, update, delete)
- **queries.ts** - Database queries for data fetching
- **schemas/** - Zod validation schemas
- **search.ts** - Search functionality

Each folder represents a domain entity (barometers, brands, documents, etc.) with its corresponding database operations.
